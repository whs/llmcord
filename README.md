llmcord transforms Discord into a collaborative LLM frontend. It works with practically any LLM, remote or locally hosted.

## Features

### Reply-based chat system:
Just @ the bot to start a conversation and reply to continue. Build conversations with reply chains!

You can:
- Branch conversations endlessly
- Continue other people's conversations
- @ the bot while replying to ANY message to include it in the conversation

Additionally:
- When DMing the bot, conversations continue automatically (no reply required). To start a fresh conversation, just @ the bot. You can still reply to continue from anywhere.
- You can branch conversations into [threads](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423-Threads-FAQ). Just create a thread from any message and @ the bot inside to continue.
- Back-to-back messages from the same user are automatically chained together. Just reply to the latest one and the bot will see all of them.

### Model switching with `/model`:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fbb9f56-9004-4997-a864-5b2ec67bac8f)

llmcord supports remote models from:
- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)
- [xAI API](https://docs.x.ai/docs/models)
- [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models)
- [Mistral API](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models/models_overview)
- [Groq API](https://console.groq.com/docs/models)
- [OpenRouter API](https://openrouter.ai/models)

Or run local models with:
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai)
- [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)

...Or use any other OpenAI compatible API server.

### And more:
- Supports image attachments when using a vision model (like gpt-4.1, grok-4, claude-4, etc.)
- Supports text file attachments (.txt, .py, .c, etc.)
- Customizable personality (aka system prompt)
- User identity aware (OpenAI API and xAI API only)
- Streamed responses (turns green when complete, automatically splits into separate messages when too long)
- Hot reloading config (you can change settings without restarting the bot)
- Displays helpful warnings when appropriate (like "⚠️ Only using last 25 messages" when the customizable message limit is exceeded)
- Caches message data in a size-managed (no memory leaks) and mutex-protected (no race conditions) global dictionary to maximize efficiency and minimize Discord API calls
- Fully asynchronous
- 1 Python file, ~200 lines of code

## Instructions

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jakobdylanc/llmcord
   ```

2. Create a copy of "config-example.yaml" named "config.yaml" and set it up:

### Discord settings:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **bot_token** | Create a new Discord bot at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and generate a token under the "Bot" tab. Also enable "MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT". |
| **client_id** | Found under the "OAuth2" tab of the Discord bot you just made. |
| **status_message** | Set a custom message that displays on the bot's Discord profile.<br /><br />**Max 128 characters.** |
| **max_text** | The maximum amount of text allowed in a single message, including text from file attachments. (Default: `100,000`) |
| **max_images** | The maximum number of image attachments allowed in a single message. (Default: `5`)<br /><br />**Only applicable when using a vision model.** |
| **max_messages** | The maximum number of messages allowed in a reply chain. When exceeded, the oldest messages are dropped. (Default: `25`) |
| **use_plain_responses** | When set to `true` the bot will use plaintext responses instead of embeds. Plaintext responses have a shorter character limit so the bot's messages may split more often. (Default: `false`)<br /><br />**Also disables streamed responses and warning messages.** |
| **allow_dms** | Set to `false` to disable direct message access. (Default: `true`) |
| **permissions** | Configure access permissions for `users`, `roles` and `channels`, each with a list of `allowed_ids` and `blocked_ids`.<br /><br />Control which `users` are admins with `admin_ids`. Admins can change the model with `/model` and DM the bot even if `allow_dms` is `false`.<br /><br />**Leave `allowed_ids` empty to allow ALL in that category.**<br /><br />**Role and channel permissions do not affect DMs.**<br /><br />**You can use [category](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001580171-Channel-Categories-101) IDs to control channel permissions in groups.** |

### LLM settings:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **providers** | Add the LLM providers you want to use, each with a `base_url` and optional `api_key` entry. Popular providers (`openai`, `ollama`, etc.) are already included.<br /><br />**Only supports OpenAI compatible APIs.**<br /><br />**Some providers may need `extra_headers` / `extra_query` / `extra_body` entries for extra HTTP data. See the included `azure-openai` provider for an example.** |
| **models** | Add the models you want to use in `<provider>/<model>: <parameters>` format (examples are included). When you run `/model` these models will show up as autocomplete suggestions.<br /><br />**Refer to each provider's documentation for supported parameters.**<br /><br />**The first model in your `models` list will be the default model at startup.**<br /><br />**Some vision models may need `:vision` added to the end of their name to enable image support.** |
| **system_prompt** | Write anything you want to customize the bot's behavior!<br /><br />**Leave blank for no system prompt.**<br /><br />**You can use the `{date}` and `{time}` tags in your system prompt to insert the current date and time, based on your host computer's time zone.** |

3. Run the bot:

   **No Docker:**
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt
   python llmcord.py
   ```

   **With Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

## Notes

- If you're having issues, try my suggestions [here](https://github.com/jakobdylanc/llmcord/issues/19)

- Only models from OpenAI API and xAI API are "user identity aware" because only they support the "name" parameter in the message object. Hopefully more providers support this in the future.

- PRs are welcome :)
